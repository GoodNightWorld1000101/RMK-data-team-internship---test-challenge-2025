# RMK data team internship - test challenge 2025
The challenge is designed to demonstrate your style, statistical thinking, documentation and coding skills.
## The challenge
Rita works in RMK Tallinn office. She takes the Tallinn city bus number 8 from Zoo to Toompark (names of
bus stops) to get to work.
Rita has a meeting at 9:05 sharp every day from Monday to Friday. It takes her 300 seconds to walk from
home to the departure bus stop and 240 seconds to walk from the destination bus stop to the meeting
room.
Plot the probability of Rita being late to the meeting depending on the time she leaves home. (Assuming
she can only use the bus to get to work.)
It might look something like this:
